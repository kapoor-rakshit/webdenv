<!--
	A new Blob object is created which takes in the content we want to copy and its type.
	A new ClipboardItem object is created into which the blob will be placed.
	Clipboard API's write() method is called, which takes in an array of ClipboardItem object.
	This method returns a Promise which is resolved when the data has been written to the clipboard or it is rejected otherwise.
