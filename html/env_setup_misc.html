<!-- HTML versus the DOM -->
<!--
When you use a web browser to request a page like https://example.com the server returns HTML.
The browser parses the HTML and creates a tree of objects. This tree of objects, or nodes, representing the page's content is called the DOM.
The page's HTML can be different than its DOM. In other words, HTML represents initial page content, and the DOM represents current page content.
When JavaScript adds, removes, or edits nodes, the DOM becomes different than the HTML.

<!-- 
The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
The data-* attribute gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
The data-* attribute consist of two parts:
    The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
    The attribute value can be any string
    
NOTE : Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user agent.

A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

og:description => This is same as <meta type=“description”> tag, unless you’d like to present it differently.
og:image       => A high resolution image that the social networks will use in their feeds.

<!-- a.
HTML symbols like mathematical operators, arrows, technical symbols and shapes, are not present on a normal keyboard.
To add these symbols to an HTML page, you can use the HTML entity name.
If no entity name exists, you can use the entity number. This number can be Hex or Dec.
Eg:  &euro; (entity name)  |  &#8364; (decimal entity number)  |  &#x20AC; (Hex entity number)

A form is not allowed to be a child element of a <table>, <tbody> or <tr>.
Attempting to put one there will tend to cause the browser to move the form to it appears after the table (while leaving its contents — table rows, table cells, inputs, etc — behind).
NOTE:
    You can have an entire table inside a form. 
    You can have a form inside a table cell  i.e.: <td><form>  ...   </form></td>
    You CANNOT have part of a table inside a form.

If the value is omitted, the original filename is used.
