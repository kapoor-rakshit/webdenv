<!-- HTML versus the DOM -->
<!--
When you use a web browser to request a page like https://example.com the server returns HTML.
The browser parses the HTML and creates a tree of objects. This tree of objects, or nodes, representing the page's content is called the DOM.
The page's HTML can be different than its DOM. In other words, HTML represents initial page content, and the DOM represents current page content.
When JavaScript adds, removes, or edits nodes, the DOM becomes different than the HTML.

Quirks Mode and Standards Mode | use of <!DOCTYPE html>
In old days of web, pages were typically written in two versions:
One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web.
There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers:
a) quirks mode - layout emulates nonstandard behavior in order to support websites that were built before widespread adoption of web standards.
b) almost standards mode - there are very small number of quirks implemented
c) full standards mode - the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications , use <!DOCTYPE html> to let browser know for full standard mode

The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
The data-* attribute gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
The data-* attribute consist of two parts:
    The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
    The attribute value can be any string
    
NOTE : Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user agent.

RESOURCE HINTS
Resource hints get their name because they are not mandatory instructions.
They provide the information about what you'd like to happen, but it's ultimately up to the browser to decide whether to execute them.
The "as" attribute helps the browser set the right headers, and determine whether the resource is already in the cache.
Example values for this attribute include: document, script, style, font, image, and others.
Some types of resources, such as fonts, are loaded in "anonymous mode". For those you must set `crossorigin` attribute.
A. rel="preload"
    Preload lets you tell browser about critical resources you want to load early before they are discovered naturally.
    This is especially useful for resources that are not easily discovered, like 
    fonts(@font-face), background-image(url: '') in stylesheets, resources loaded from script(CSS added via JS).
    The preload resource hint helps browser to discover a resource faster and thus load it before document loads it and affects priority.
    Preload is a mandatory fetch and not a hint.
B. rel="preconnect"
    Before browser can request resource from server, it must establish a connection. Establishing a secure connection involves three steps:
        Look up the domain name and resolve it to an IP address.
        Set up a connection to the server.
        Encrypt the connection for security.
    In each of these steps the browser sends a piece of data to a server, and the server sends back a response.
    That journey, from origin to destination and back, is called a round trip.
    Depending on network conditions, a single round trip might take a significant amount of time.
    Adding rel=preconnect to a <link> informs browser that your page intends to establish a connection to another domain,
    and that you'd like the process to start as soon as possible.
    Resources will load more quickly because setup process has already been completed by the time the browser requests them.
    Preconnecting is only effective for CROSS-ORIGIN i.e. when you know an origin but not necessarily exact URL of resource that will be needed.
C. rel="prefetch"
    If you have insight into how users move through your website and which pages they will likely visit next,
    you can improve load times of future navigations by downloading the resources for those pages ahead of time.
    Only prefetch resources when you are confident that users will need them.
D. fetchpriority="high"
    Fetch Priority is a markup-based signal that developers can use to indicate the relative priority of a particular resource.
    Fetch Priority can also complement preload. Take a Largest Contentful Paint image, which, when preloaded, will still get a low priority,
    If it is pushed back by other early low-priority resources, using Fetch Priority can help how soon the image gets loaded.
    Preload allows the browser to discover the resource early, but it will still fetch it with the default priority.
    Conversely, Fetch Priority does not aid discoverability, but does allow you to increase or decrease the fetch priority.
    fetchpriority attribute accepts "high", "low", "auto"(let browser decide appropriate priority)
-->
<link rel="preload" as="script" href="critical.js" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
<link rel="prefetch" href="/articles/" as="document">
<img src="/images/in_viewport_but_not_important.svg" fetchpriority="low">   <!-- NOT a high priority for this above-the-fold image -->
<link rel="preload" href="/js/script.js" as="script" fetchpriority="low">   <!-- initiate an early fetch for resource, but also deprioritize it -->
<script src="JS" async fetchpriority="high"></script>                       <!-- async but important JS -->
<script src="JS" fetchpriority="low"></script>                              <!-- blocking but unimportant JS -->


<!-- 18 -->
<!--
To allow cross-origin access, the <script> tag needs to have crossorigin attribute, plus remote server must provide special headers.
There are three levels of cross-origin access:
    No crossorigin attribute – access prohibited.
    crossorigin="anonymous" – access allowed if server responds with header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: *  OR  our origin.
        Browser does NOT send authorization information and cookies to remote server.
        i.e. no cookies sent AND one server-side header needed.
    crossorigin="use-credentials" – access allowed if server sends back header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with our origin and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: true.
        Browser sends authorization information and cookies to remote server.
        i.e. sends cookies too AND two server-side headers needed.
